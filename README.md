# :t-rex: Chrome Dinosaur Game 

The classic Google Chrome game that appears when your connection to the internet is lost.

Can you play as Dino to avoid all the obstacles (cactuses and the pterodactyls) to get the highest score?
All you need to do is press arrow (:arrow_up:) up to jump over some obstacles or press arrow down (:arrow_down:) to crouch under other obstacles. It is that simple.


This mini-game was created using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library.
