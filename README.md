# :t-rex: Chrome Dinosaur Game 

### The classic Chrome game, when your connection to the internet is lost.

### Can you play as Dino to avoid all the obstacles (catuses and the pterodactyls) to get the highest score?
### All you need to do is press arrow (:arrow_up:) up to jump over some obstacles or press arrow down (:arrow_down:) to crouch under other obstacles. It is that simple.


### This mini-game was created using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library. :snake:
